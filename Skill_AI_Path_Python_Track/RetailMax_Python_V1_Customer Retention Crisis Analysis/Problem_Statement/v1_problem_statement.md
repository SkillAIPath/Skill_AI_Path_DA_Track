2. **Segment Analysis:** Which customer groups are most affected?
3. **Geographic Impact:** Are specific cities/regions more affected?
4. **Product Analysis:** Which categories are losing customers?
5. **Revenue Recovery:** How much can we recover and how?

### **Success Criteria:**
- **Immediate:** Present findings to CEO within 5 days
- **Actionable:** Provide specific recommendations, not just insights
- **Measurable:** Quantify impact and recovery potential
- **Executive-Ready:** Charts and insights suitable for board presentation

## üîç **DETAILED ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS**

### **Day 1-2: Data Exploration & Cleaning**
**Learning Focus:** Python basics, pandas fundamentals, data quality assessment

**Tasks:**
- Load and inspect all datasets
- Identify data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- Understand customer journey from registration to churn
- Create data dictionary and basic statistics

**Key Questions:**
- How many customers do we have in total?
- What's the data quality like?
- What time period does our data cover?
- What are the key customer attributes?

**Expected Python Skills:**
```python
# Basic data loading and inspection
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Data quality assessment
customers.info()
customers.describe()
customers.isnull().sum()

# Basic aggregations
customers.groupby('city').size()
orders.groupby('customer_id').agg({'order_value': 'sum'})
```

### **Day 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis**
**Learning Focus:** Advanced pandas operations, groupby, customer analytics

**Tasks:**
- Segment customers by value (High, Medium, Low)
- Analyze churn rates by segment
- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Identify most valuable customer groups

**Key Questions:**
- Which customer segments have highest churn?
- How does CLV vary by segment?
- What's the geographic distribution of valuable customers?
- Which segments should we prioritize for retention?

**Expected Python Skills:**
```python
# Customer segmentation
customers['segment'] = pd.cut(customers['total_spent'], 
                             bins=[0, 15000, 50000, float('inf')],
                             labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])

# Churn analysis
churn_by_segment = customers.groupby('segment')['churned'].mean()

# CLV calculation
customers['clv'] = customers['total_spent'] / customers['tenure_months']
```

### **Day 4: Geographic & Product Analysis**
**Learning Focus:** Multi-dimensional analysis, visualization, business insights

**Tasks:**
- Analyze churn rates by city and region
- Identify product categories losing customers
- Examine seasonal patterns in customer behavior
- Calculate revenue impact by geography and product

**Key Questions:**
- Which cities have highest churn rates?
- Are certain product categories driving churn?
- Is there a seasonal pattern to customer loss?
- How much revenue is at risk in each city?

**Expected Python Skills:**
```python
# Geographic analysis
city_churn = customers.groupby('city').agg({
    'churned': 'mean',
    'total_spent': 'sum',
    'customer_id': 'count'
})

# Product analysis
product_churn = orders.merge(customers, on='customer_id')\
                     .groupby('product_category')['churned'].mean()

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### **Day 5: Insights & Recommendations**
**Learning Focus:** Business storytelling, executive communication, actionable insights

**Tasks:**
