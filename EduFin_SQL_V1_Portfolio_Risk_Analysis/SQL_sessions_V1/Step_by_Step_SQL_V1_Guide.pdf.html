        <p>This guide explains the <strong>logic and thinking process</strong> behind each SQL analysis step. For each step, you'll learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What:</strong> What the step is doing with the data</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Why this logic or calculation is necessary</li>
            <li><strong>Insight:</strong> What business value or insight it generates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No SQL code is included - this focuses purely on understanding the analytical thinking process that drives effective data analysis.</p>

                        <span class="label">What:</span> We extract year and month information from loan disbursement dates and create organized time periods (like "2024-03" for March 2024) to group loans by when they were given out.

                        <span class="label">Why:</span> Understanding timing patterns is crucial for identifying when problems started. Seasonal trends, economic events, or policy changes often show up as time-based patterns in loan performance.

                        <span class="label">Why:</span> Disbursement patterns show business activity levels and help identify periods of rapid expansion or contraction. High disbursement months represent higher risk exposure if problems develop later.
